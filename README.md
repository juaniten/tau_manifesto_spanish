# The Tau Manifesto, Spanish version

This is the LaTeX source of the Spanish version of [*The Tau Manifesto*](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto), copyright © 2010–2023 by Michael Hartl.  

This is a amateur translation made with love by me, [@juaniten](https://github.com/juaniten). I am not a professional translator, so any suggestions are welcome.

## Softcover setup

1. Install the `softcover` Ruby gem and get the document to build locally by following the instructions in [*The Softcover Book*](http://manual.softcover.io/book). (If your system isn't already configured as a Ruby development environment, see [*Learn Enough Dev Environment to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/dev-environment-tutorial).)
2. Edit the file `chapters/tau_manifesto.tex` to make the translation. See especially the section [Foreign language support](http://manual.softcover.io/book/customization#sec-foreign_language) in the Softcover manual.
