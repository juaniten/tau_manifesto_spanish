## About This Translation  

This is an amateur translation made with love by me, [@juaniten](https://github.com/juaniten). While I am not a professional translator, I’ve done my best to stay true to the original text. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are always welcome!  

## Building the Document  

To compile the document locally:  

1. Install the `softcover` Ruby gem and set up your environment by following the instructions in *The Softcover Book*.  
   - If you don’t have a Ruby development environment set up, check out [*Learn Enough Dev Environment to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/dev-environment-tutorial) for guidance.  
2. Edit `chapters/tau_manifesto.tex` to modify or improve the translation.  
3. Refer to the *Softcover* manual, especially the *Foreign Language Support* section, for additional guidance.  

Happy reading, and long live Tau!
